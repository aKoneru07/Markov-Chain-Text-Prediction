# Markov Chain Text Prediction
Project for Linear Algebra Class

I was tasked with implementing a real-life application for our Linear Algebra coursework.

My topic of choice: *Markov Chains*

This script analyzes 16 different Stephen King novels and builds a Markovian distribution based on the word usage. Then, it randomly picks a starting sequence and generates a passage of variable length.
